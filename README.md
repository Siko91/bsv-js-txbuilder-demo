# BSV TS Example - how to create simple BSV Transactions

## How to run?

I used `ts-node index.ts` to run this demo.

You could do the same, or you could build the code into JS and then run it.

It should work either way.

## What does it do?

In `index.ts` it shows how to work with the `PubKey`, `PrivKey` and `Address` classes.

In `demos/constructTxDemo.ts` it shows how to use the `TxBuilder` class.

In `demos/logInfoAboutTx.ts` it shows how to read data from the `Tx` class.
